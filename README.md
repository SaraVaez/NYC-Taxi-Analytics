## 🧠 Problem Statement

Taxi drivers in NYC rely heavily on tips. This project predicts whether a customer will tip or not, based on features such as fare amount, distance, time of day, and more.

## 🧹 Data Processing & EDA

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Outlier handling
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Hypothesis testing
- Statistical summaries and visualizations

## 🤖 Models Used

- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

## 📈 Results

The final model provides high accuracy in identifying customers who are unlikely to tip. This model can be deployed in apps used by taxi drivers.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Add dashboard or web app interface
- Improve model with more features (weather, locations, etc.)
- Monitor real-time predictions

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Install required libraries (requirements.txt will be added)
3. Run the notebooks in JupyterLab or VS Code
